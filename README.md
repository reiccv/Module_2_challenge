# Module 2 Challenge Loan Qualifier Application

This is a python command-line interface application that allows users to see qualifying loans from lenders quickly and easily. The application works by taking in a `daily_rate_sheet` of loan criteria from various loan providers, asking the user a number of questions to evaluate their loan eligibility, and then returning to them a list of qualifying loans. The challenge was essentially to create and save 'qualifying_loans.csv'.
